# Comparison of keypoint detectors precision
The experiments to compare the precision of a range of state-of-the-art keypoint detection methods.

The following keypoint detection methods were compared:
- SIFT
- r2d2
- SIFT+RLOF
- ALIKE
- Superpoints
- ORB

These experiments and the obtained results are described in papers:
["In search of the most precise keypoint detection method"](https://medium.com/@pankovan7/in-search-of-the-most-precise-keypoint-detection-method-b30b2608105f)
 and ["Как мы искали самый точный метод детектирования ключевых точек"](https://habr.com/ru/post/724580/).

The following repos were used for the experiments:
